Hello! I'm a second year PhD student at Stanford University advised by Professor [Chelsea Finn](https://ai.stanford.edu/~cbfinn/) and [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi). My research interests lie in developing large-scale foundational robotic agents that are broadly generalizable to new environments and tasks. My long-term goal is to enable scalable lifelong robotic learning in the real world.

Previously, I've obtained a B.S. in EECS at UC Berkeley and conducted research in the [Robotic AI and Learning Lab](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu).

For more information, check out my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV-19.pdf)!
